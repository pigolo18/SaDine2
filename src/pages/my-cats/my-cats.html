                        I usually just call him Fel. He’s a quiet and calm 5 year old cat. Even when he was still
                        a kitten, he would always be alone, sleeping and ignoring his siblings. And unlike most cats 
                        that bite when you let them on the stomach area, he usually just stares at you when you do 
                        that to him. He likes to ignore me. He likes to ignore the people around him. He may act 
                        like that but he usually misses me whenever I leave the house for a few days to spend my 
                        vacation somewhere else.

                        She used to have a brother named Snow as my mother really liked the Snowbear mint candies. 
                        She is Feliciano and Kitkat’s daughter. She acts like Kitkat but she looks more of her 
                        father. She is currently pregnant and is bound to give birth next month.

                        My feline daughter. As a kitten, she was a very playful and active animal. She is now 
                        3 years old and has toned down her playfulness a little bit. She acts like most common 
                        cats, but she is the most affectionate out of all my pets that’s why I love her.
