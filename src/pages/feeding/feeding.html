                                             Decide on what type of food you want to feed your cat. There is dry food, 
                                      semi-moist, and canned food. Dry food is the easiest to find and more affordable 
                                      than the latter, but cats love the taste of semi-most and canned food more. Still, 
                                      the decision is up to the owner of the cat.

                                       Choose a good brand of cat food. This depends solely on your cat. I used to 
                                      feed my cat this one famous brand of cat food, but soon realised that it was the 
                                      same thing that made him sick. If you want a more accurate answer on what brand of 
                                      cat food is good for your feline friends, you can go to your vet and ask suggestions 
                                      about a good quality product food.
                                      <br><br>
                                        Follow your cat’s suggested feeding guide. The amount and type of food you 
                                        should feed your cat depends on its age, weight, and activity levels.

                                         Don’t overfeed your cat. Obesity is one of the most faced health issues cats 
                                        have today, so always follow what your vet recommends you to do. Also, making sure 
                                        that your cat gets plenty of exercise, aka taking your cat for a walk, may help 
                                        reduce this factor.
