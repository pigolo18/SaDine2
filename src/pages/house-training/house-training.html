                 Teach a cat to use a litter box or train them to use the bathroom. Most of my cats use 
                the bathroom. They know how to do their business there. I taught them this by keeping them 
                inside the bathroom for an hour after feeding them. The kittens however can learn this from 
                their parent.

                   Provide the cat with a scratching post. Unless you want the door frames and sofas of 
                  your house with scratch marks, then skip this step. The scratch post will help the cat live 
                  a normal, healthy life since it is part of their nature which they got from their feline 
                  ancestors in the old age.
