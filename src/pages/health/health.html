                                       Keeping your cats fur in perfect balance. Even though cats may usually groom 
                                      themselves doesn’t mean we don’t need to groom them ourselves. Long-haired cats 
                                      are usually the ones in need of brushing several times a week since their fur may 
                                      get into tangles and could get them in danger.

                                        Check your cats skin condition as you brush. Keep an eye on fleas and 
                                        other parasites that may have taken shelter in your cats skin. Also take note 
                                        if their are any unusual redness and bumps on your cats skin and make sure to bring 
                                        your cat to a vet immediately.

                                          Schedule yearly vet visits. Cats are like humans too who needs their own 
                                          health checked yearly. Our feline friends rely on us humans to take care of them, 
                                          and unlike other humans, cats cannot tell us whether or not something feels wrong for them.

                                        Frequently bring your kitten to vets. Just like human babies, kittens are also in 
                                          danger of getting serious health issues in the early stages of life. Make sure to 
                                          bring them to your vet to keep them healthy and active.

                                         Give your cat a toothbrush. Yes, cats do need to have their teeth brushed too. 
                                          And yes, even they can get dental issues. A soft-bristled toothbrush and a veterinarian 
                                          toothpaste is what you need to keep your cat’s teeth perfect.

                                          Make sure to keep your cat active daily. Cats need a lot of playtime, so make sure 
                                          to buy toys for your cats. You can also talk to them while you’re grooming them to 
                                          strengthen the bond between you.
